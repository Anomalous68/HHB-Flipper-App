# Hard Hat Brigade Flipper Zero App
Flipper Zero app for a hardhat that will be at Defcon.

Code credit goes to @jamisonderek, the majority of the code is taken from his Basic Scenes tutorial, https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/tree/main/ui/basic_scenes.

### Notes
Type message, then point at reciever and press enter. The slight pause is when the message is transmitting, once "Message sent" appears, the hat should display it.
